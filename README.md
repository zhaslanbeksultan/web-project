Web-Project "Messenger"

Our team members:
   Zhaslan Beksultan,
   Amangeldi Madina,
   Bayaly Arailym,

The web-app that we are going to create is "Messenger"


Short description of our application:
    Our application will have a view where users signup using a username. To
allow this, weâ€™ll set up a Django server to store the usernames and authorize users. 
    Upon logging in, users are asked to input their nickname, 
which will then be stored within the application. 
Additionally, there exists a message input field along with a send button.
Messages sent through this interface will be displayed in the chat window 
alongside the corresponding nickname.
    The frontend application will be built using Angular; we can bootstrap 
a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
